          <h2>Intersectionality in Simple Terms:</h2>
          <h3>Intersectionality is a framework that examines how different social identities (such as race, gender, sexuality, and class) overlap and create unique experiences of discrimination and privilege.</h3>

          <h2> Implicit Bias </h2>
          <p>  Implicit bias is the attitude or internalized stereotypes that unconsciously affect our perceptions, actions, and decisions; mostly negatively. It is typically shaped by experience and based on learned associations between particular qualities and social categories, including race and/or gender.</p>

            <h3> Maddie's Interpretations...</h3>
            <p> I recently took the Harvard Implicit Bias Test, specifically the gender-career assessment. I found the test intriguing and could clearly see how it reveals people's implicit biases about which genders are associated with certain professions. Personally, I consider myself aware of the typical stereotypes surrounding gender and careers, so I didn't find it difficult to respond without letting those biases influence my answers.

To me, intersectionality is essentially about how different aspects of a person's identity—such as gender, race, and other social categories—interconnect and shape their day-to-day experiences. While completing the IBT, it was fascinating to reflect on how these implicit biases originate and become so deeply ingrained in our society. It's startling to realize that individuals are often expected to succeed in specific fields purely based on their gender or race, rather than their actual skills and knowledge. Essentially, their success is judged not by their abilities but by societal perceptions of their identity. </p>

            <h3>Daniel's Interpretations...</h3>
            <p>I recently took the Age Implicit Bias test, which started by displaying the faces of either older or younger individuals, and I had to quickly identify which age group they belonged to. The test then transitioned to associating certain words with either "good" or "bad" categories. Initially, it felt like a simple reaction test, but as I progressed, I began to see how the test was uncovering implicit biases.

The experience helped me recognize biases I may hold unconsciously, which I found eye-opening. It's fascinating to consider how these biases can be shaped by upbringing or societal influences, and how they may affect our attitudes and decision-making processes without us even realizing it. The test serves as a useful tool in highlighting biases, particularly around age, and encourages a deeper reflection on how they manifest in our daily lives and choices. </p>

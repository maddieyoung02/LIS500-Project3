                <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
                <p>In simple terms, machine learning is a way for computers to learn patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task. It's like teaching a computer to recognize things by showing it examples.</p>
                <h3>Type 1: Supervised Learning</h3>
                <p>The computer learns from labeled examples - data where we already know the correct answers. For instance, if you're training a model to classify images of cats and dogs, you'd give it a dataset of images labeled as either "cat" or "dog." The computer uses these labels to learn how to make predictions on new, unseen images.</p>
                <p>Key Features: input data and corresponding labels, and the goal is to predict the correct label for new data. </p>
                <p> Examples: image classification, spam email detection, stock price detection.</p>

                <h3>Type 2: Unsupervised Learning</h3>
                <p>The computer gets data but no labels. It tries to find patterns, groupings, or structure on its own. For example, if you give it a bunch of images without labels, it might group them into clusters based on similarities, like grouping animals with fur together.</p>
                <p>Key Features: input data (but no labels), and the goal is to find hidden patterns or groupings in the data.</p>
                <p> Examples: customer segmentation, anomaly detection, clustering similar products.</p>

            <h2>Our Process</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Choosing our categories for the image classifcation:</h3>
            <p>We started by choosing what categories we wanted our model to classify between... We chose elephants, ducks, and butterflies because they are diverse in their features—size, texture, and patterns—challenging the model to recognize distinct categories. This reflects themes in
              Unmasking AI, where Joy Buolamwini stresses the importance of diversity and fairness in AI systems. By testing our model with such varied categories, we aimed to explore its limitations and better understand how biases in training data could affect its performance.</p>

            <h4>Steps We Took to Address Bias and Fairness:</h4>
            <p> 1. Diverse Data Sources: To promote fairness and inclusivity, we used a variety of images from different sources. For the main categories—elephants, ducks, and butterflies—we combined images found online with our own photos captured using a webcam. These home-captured images included objects that resembled or
              represented these categories, ensuring a broader range of training data. </p>
            <p> 2. Incorporating a 'Nothing' Category: We introduced a 'nothing' category to handle inputs that do not fit into any of the three main labels. For this category,
              we provided the model with diverse data, including images of people's faces from various racial, age, and emotional groups,
              as well as photos with different backgrounds and colors. This was a deliberate step to train the model to differentiate between unrelated
              inputs and the core categories, reflecting the importance of minimizing false assumptions—a key
              theme in Unmasking AI. </p>

            <h4>How Our Efforts Relate to Themes in Unmasking AI:</h4>
            <p>While our model is limited in scope, the care we took in building the dataset mirrors some of the larger concerns discussed in Unmasking AI. Joy Buolamwini highlights how biased or incomplete datasets lead to unfair outcomes in AI systems. In our case, we aimed to ensure that the model's training data was as diverse as possible, even within the constraints of a small-scale project. By including images representing different races, emotions, and backgrounds in the 'nothing' category, we addressed the issue of bias, albeit at a basic level, and reinforced the
              importance of ethical considerations in AI development. </p>

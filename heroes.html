                <h2>Kimberly Bryant</h2>
                <p>One of my biggest inspirations in the tech world is Kimberly Bryant, the visionary founder of Girls Who Code. Her mission to close the gender gap in technology resonates deeply with me, and I admire her relentless drive to empower young women to embrace coding and innovation. Kimberly's accomplishments are truly remarkable, and it’s invigorating to witness a strong female leader making such a significant impact in an industry that often lacks diversity. I’m excited to dive into the course material, knowing it aligns with her vision and the broader goal of fostering success for women in tech. She addresses the unique challenges faced by women of color in the tech industry by focusing specifically on young Black girls, a group that experiences marginalization at the intersections of race and gender. This dual focus highlights how issues of gender disparity and racial inequality intersect to create distinct barriers for women of color in technology, which differ from those experienced by white women or men of color.</p>

                <h2>Dr. Timnit Gebru</h2>
                <p>One of the most inspiring figures in the tech world for me is Dr. Timnit Gebru, a prominent computer scientist and advocate for diversity and ethics in artificial intelligence. Her work emphasizes the importance of representation in technology and the need to address the ethical implications of AI.

As someone passionate about AI, I admire her efforts to challenge biases in AI systems. Dr. Gebru shows that technology can drive positive change when developed with ethical considerations and diverse perspectives. Her commitment to advocating for inclusivity in tech inspires me to engage more critically with the technologies we create. I’m excited to learn from her work and explore how we can contribute to a more equitable tech landscape. Dr. Timnit Gebru reflects intersectionality in tech by addressing the intertwined issues of race, gender, and ethics in artificial intelligence (AI) and the broader technology industry. As a Black woman in a field dominated by white men, she faces multiple layers of marginalization, and her work actively challenges these inequalities while advocating for the inclusion of diverse voices in the development of AI technologies.</p>

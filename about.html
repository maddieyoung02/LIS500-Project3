                <h3>BS in Data Science</h3>
                <p>Hi, I’m Maddie Young. I am a current senior studying data science along with certificates in economics analytics and digital studies. I am taking this course to fulfill a requirement for my digital studies certificate, but I also am interested in the course material as it seems like a cool intersection with data science. I have always been interested in technology, and feel as though it comes natural to me. I love hearing about new technological advancements and innovations.</p>

                <h3>Personal Finance</h3>
                <p>Hi, I’m Daniel Laatsch and I am a senior. I am currently studying personal finance along with a certificate in entrepreneurship. I am taking this course because it seemed to be very interesting to me and fit well with a flexible schedule. I am excited to continue learning more about technology along with a little bit of how it actually works. I am really fascinated by the idea of web browsers and networks and trying to understand a little bit about how that actually works. I'm also really excited with the idea of where technology can bring us and how it will continue to develop over the years short-term and long-term.</p>

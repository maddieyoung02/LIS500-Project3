                <h3>BS in Data Science</h3>
                <p>Hi, I’m Maddie Young. I am a current senior studying data science along with certificates in economics analytics and digital studies. I am taking this course to fulfill a requirement for my digital studies certificate, but I also am interested in the course material as it seems like a cool intersection with data science. I have always been interested in technology, and feel as though it comes natural to me. I love hearing about new technological advancements and innovations.</p>

                <p>I'm a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, originally from Sacramento, California, majoring in Communication Arts with a certificate in Digital Studies.
